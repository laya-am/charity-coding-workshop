# What is JavaScript?

JavaScript is a programming language that allows you to implement complex features on web pages — every time a web page does more than just sit there and display static information for you to look at — displaying timely content updates, interactive maps, animated 2D/3D graphics, scrolling, videos, etc. — you can bet that JavaScript is probably involved. It is the third layer of the layer cake of standard web technologies.

JavaScript is where the magic happens, where we define all the interaction of the website. For today this is out of the scope, we will give you an already defined function that we are going to use.
