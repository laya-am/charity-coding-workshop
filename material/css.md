# What is CSS?

CSS means Cascading Stylesheets. While HTML defines the structure and semantics of your content, we use CSS for design and layout.

- Selector: A CSS selector is used to specify the elements to which CSS rules apply.
- Property: Name for a particular property to which a value is attributed.
- Value: The value we assign to a property.
- Declaration: Each pair of property and value is a declaration.

we only show `.class` selectors to keep specificity simple at `(0,1,0)`.
if the participants want to overwrite styles, they should either edit the class or write add a new one, but keep them in order of how they want the styles to be applied.
